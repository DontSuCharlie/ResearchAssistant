Chrome Extension that helps define highlighted terms. Simply tap on a short-cut key you defined, and everything you highlight will be entered into the [Freebase](http://www.freebase.com) search engine, extracted, and displayed on a small pop up window. You can even highlight the pop up's text to continue on and on.

Changing shortcut key can be done with the icon on the top right corner, along with various other options.

In each pop-up, there will be scrollable (so it doesn't take too much space), and the following options:

Close - closes current pop-up
Close All - closes all pop-ups
Visit Page - create new tab that directs you to that page
Bookmark - bookmarks the Wikipedia page
